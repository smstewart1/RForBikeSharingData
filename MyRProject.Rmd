# About Data Analysis Report

This RMarkdown file contains the report of the data analysis done for the project on forecasting daily bike rental demand using time series models in R. It contains analysis such as data exploration, summary statistics and building the time series models. The final report was completed on `r date()`. 

**Data Description:**

This dataset contains the daily count of rental bike transactions between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.

**Data Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset

# Task Six: Findings and Conclusions

After processing the raw data and using the ARIMA package to model ride share data, I was able to make predictions for the 25 days beyond the current data set.  Qualitatively the data shows that was the weather gets warmer the number of bike rentals increase, and over the course of two years the number of rentals increases over the number of rentals from the previous year.  As the data terminates at the end of one cycle, I expect the number of rentals to increase to a level higher than it was a year before, which is what the models are predicting.  Therefore the results were what I expected - the data appears to oscillate up and down over a 1 year period with the overall data moving towards higher rental numbers.
